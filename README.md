# Source SDK 2013 BDS Base

This is a Source SDK 2013 fork made for the purpose of giving a reliable mod base for currently updated and future Bitl Development Studio (BDS) mod projects.
This was based off the TF2 SDK release, and will be updated as the SDK updates.

This will feature sources for some currently updated and future Bitl Development Studio (BDS) mod projects. 
This base is specific to multiplayer mod projects.

## Projects using this base:
- TBA

## Features:
- Restored game project generator scripts. No more having to generate every project!
- Implements various pull requests from the master repo, allowing for a stable and reliable mod base.
- Build scripts for Half-Life 2, Lost Coast, and HL2 episodes, with NextBot support.
    - NOTE: You may need to do some tinkering to make these singleplayer projects work well with the new SDK base. There are some bugs and crashes that won't be addressed by this base.
- NPC NextBot sensing support from FIREFIGHT RELOADED.
- Integrated Python binaries (on Windows) for more simple buiding.
